          <h1>Beautiful Thailand</h1>
          <p>
            Thailand is a mecca for rock-climbing and after working at Ping Yang Pow (PYP) I've grown an affinity for traditional Thai food, so long as it's not too spicy!

        <h2>My friends that have gone there said</h2>
        <ul>
          <blockquote>
            <li>You can sit in front of a (climbing) project for a month and not get bored</li>
            <li class="bg-info">Don't get cocky about your spice level, when they say Thai spice they mean it!</li>
            <li>It's really cheap which is good on your wallet but can be hard to see, gives a lot of perspective</li>
            <li>Buy a couple of nice suits when you're there, you can get 5 for $600 instead of 1 for $5,000</li>
